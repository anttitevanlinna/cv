    <h1>younited by F-Secure</h1>
       <p>
The younited by F-Secure was a high profile product launch for the company. I acted as the technical project manager handling the product and all marketing-related systems in the launch. Since then younited has changed a bit, but you'll still get the point if you visit <a href="www.younited.com">younited.com</a>.

Our marketing automation system was queueing people, and we were excited to have 10K registrations on the first day. We thereafter managed the intake of people in a controlled fashion, and made follow-up campaigns to get people to post and brag in the social media.

The other noteworthy element is the in-application-eStore. If you have installed the Windows or Mac application, you will see an option to buy more storage space. That is a customized eStore which is shown inside the application and the buying is seamlessly integrated to the normal use. It took a bit a bit of work of to get right in terms of business model and user experience. The younited storage is also sold in iTunes and Play store as mobile in-application purchase. Those flows were also defined by me. In the end, the most tricky part was defining a subscription model that suited both mobile application stores, in-application-eStore, and traditional voucher sales. (And yep, I defined all those business rules, believe me.)

I found myself as the second project manager in a project that had something like 12 teams and 10+ manager-types. F-Secure had decided to pull of a large system that would transform the core business that was making 50 or so million euros a year. We had no method for doing scrum in such an environment, and quite little concensus inside the product management of "what the system is supposed to do". 
      </p>
       <p>
We ended up a system that was able to many great things. It was able to release all software every two weeks to a beta where 10000 users would use it and give feedback. We would have very high predictability for the next 3 months, and we could structurally plan ahead to 6 months. People were free to take initiative on what to improve, and communities would govern over quality and architecture.

It took us a year to figure out to really figure out how to develop in that scale. I need to say "we", since there were multiple other key people who contributed to the way of working. I'm happy to claim that I'm one of the handfull of people who understood why it worked.

We were out to solve the "messyness of sales" dilemma in the F-Secure's reseller channel. We would use to get faxes, phonecalls, excels, and emails in as orders. At the same time the resellers were using our portal for their daily activities, so why not enable them to make their orders there?
      </p>
       <p>
It was supposed to be a projet of medium difficulty, but it became quite a drag. We had consultants coming in, no clear requirements, and no skill in doing integrations inside our IT. I was happily managing the "portal side of the things" - the UI-layer. I got sucked into managing the integration consultants, Siebel stuff, and a bit of SAP. 
      </p>
       <p>
Currently most of the sales happens realtime, with the facilities created at that time. But what did I really learn from that? That it is not at all that difficult to do CRM, integrations, and "eBusiness". (And also the way not to those projects)
