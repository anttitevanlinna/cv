    <h1>younited by F-Secure</h1>
       <p>
I acted as the technical project manager handling the product and all marketing-related systems in the launch. 
The younited by F-Secure was a high profile product launch for the company. Since then younited has changed a bit, but you'll still get the point if you visit <a href="www.younited.com">younited.com</a>. 
      </p>
       <p>
Our marketing automation system was queueing people, and we were excited to have 10K registrations on the first day. We thereafter managed the intake of people in a controlled fashion, and made follow-up campaigns to get people to post and brag in the social media. 
      </p>
       <p>
The other noteworthy element is the in-application-eStore. If you have installed the Windows or Mac application, you will see an option to buy more storage space. That is a customized eStore which is shown inside the application and the buying is seamlessly integrated to the normal use. It took a bit a bit of work of to get right in terms of business model and user experience. The younited storage is also sold in iTunes and Play store as mobile in-application purchase. Those flows were also defined by me. In the end, the most tricky part was defining a subscription model that suited both mobile application stores, in-application-eStore, and traditional voucher sales. (And yep, I defined all those business rules, believe me.)

    <h1>Some of the largest and earliest Agile Scrumming in Finland</h1>
       <p>
I started as a project manager in a project that had 10+ teams (3 backend, 5 clientside, 4 clientside in Malaysia) and the related management layers. Later on we added 5 subcontracted teams. F-Secure had decided to pull of a large system that would transform the core business that was making 50 or so million euros a year. We had no method for doing scrum in such an environment, and quite little concensus inside the product management of what the system is supposed to do. 
      </p>
       <p>
We ended up with a development methodology that was able to many great things. It was able to release all software every two weeks to a beta where 10000 users would use it and give feedback. We would have very high predictability for the next 3 months, and we could structurally plan ahead to 6 months. We had a single backlog for the entire product, and we had a clear delegation model on how to get selected items developed. People were free to take initiative on what to improve, and communities would govern over quality and architecture. Most large-scale Agile implementations still struggle on these very points. 
      </p>
       <p>
It took us a year to really figure out how to develop in that scale. I need to say "we", since there were multiple other key people who contributed to the way of working. I'm happy to claim that I'm one of the handful of people who understood why it worked. While I left for an expatriate assignment, I was the lead project manager, and in control.

I have been writing to my personal blog on Agile, management, and competence development. Much of the content has been either thought or written during those years. You can find my blog in: <a href="https://anttitevanlinna.wordpress.com/">https://anttitevanlinna.wordpress.com/</a>.

<h1>Software Delivery: From Global, Slow, and Undefined into Standardized, Quick, and Automated</h1>
      <p>
I acted as the head of technical delivery in F-Secure Content Cloud business unit. We had a small team that managed the build-up process
for operator-customized cloud instances. The scale of the operation was quite sizeable in the end: we delivered 25 customized operator cloud instances, each with 6 customized applications. We customized the ios, Android, Windows Phone, Windows, Mac, and Web clients. We 
coordinated the set up the necessary backend infrastructure with F-Secure hosting. 
      </p>
       <p>
Such was not the initial setup. We started with most hallmarks of the slow and unrepeatable processes. There we excels, there were emails,
nobody had a specification of what is subject to customization, and people's perception of the settings varied. Altogether the build-up
process would require work from 10 teams. 
      </p>
       <p>
Rework, confusion, and errors were a daily nuisance. We started working bit by bit to work our way onto more firm ground. We went from 10 teams
to 3, with clear roles. Our team was managing the overall process.
      </p>
       <p>
There were two tools that facilitated our journey. Firstly, we set up a "perfection goal", which guided our choices on the way. We said
that we want to automate the flow to the extent that the operators themselves could do it. That is, the perfection goal was to 
remove the manual work altogether. The other tool was iterative improvement. There simply was no way to bridge the gap between the 
current operating model and the perfection goal. Instead we decided to start automating the parts one-by-one, on a weekly basis. 
We continued, things speeded up, and grew more defined. This opened new possibilities. This process took a year. 
      </p>
       <p>
The 10 teams all had brought their specific competence to the process. As our efforts in streamlining continued, we could remove the teams
from the loop one by one. Automation brought precision. The precision reduced the defects introduced by 90%, and it eradicated whole
classes of defects. Most importantly however, the precision enables the further streamlining of the process. 
      </p>
       <p>
I have been fortunate to be involved in the process development of the F-Secure operator delivery model. 
That model serves 200 operator customers. Many of the 
best practices that we put in place were not my original thinking. In this case however, I was in charge of implementing all of them.

    <h1>F-Secure Protection Service for Business Online Sales</h1>
       <p>
I managed the development of the F-Secure Protection Service for Business backend during the development and the time when we grew to 1 million revenue. One of the more interesting development items during the time was the online sales of the service.
      </p>
       <p>
We were out to streamline the sales in the F-Secure's reseller channel. We would get faxes, phonecalls, excels, and emails in as orders. The orders would be procesed manually, and it would take often a week to get the license in use. At the same time the resellers were using our portal for their daily activities, so why not enable them to make their orders there?
      </p>
       <p>
I was the project manager of the portal part, but became the lead for the overall delivery. It was supposed to be a projet of medium difficulty, but it became quite a lot more difficult than anticipated. We had consultants coming in, no clear requirements, and no skill in doing integrations inside our IT. I was happily managing the "portal side of the things" - the UI-layer. Bit-by-bit, I took over the managing the integration consultants, Siebel stuff, and a bit of SAP. I helped our IT to kick-start a Scrum initiative, and I acted until the end of the project as the Product Owner for the IT team. We launched and the resellers started happily using the new system.
      </p>
       <p>
Currently most of the sales happens realtime, with the facilities created at that time. But what did I really learn from that? That it is not at all that difficult to do CRM, integrations, and "eBusiness". (And also the way not to those projects).
