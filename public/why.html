<p>
It's hip to do an app as a CV. While LinkedIn can tell a lot, it doesn't quite convey what can one do. The limitations of traditional CV format are quite huge. Making an app that does cool stuff can much better showcase your talents. This site is an app that will handle the journey of getting to know Antti's history, personality, and achievements. The BIO section gives a few links to the stuff that I've been working with over the years.

Just one thing: I'm not graphically sawwy. I'm not really a frontend coder. The surface that you see is merely there to give you an idea what the tools can do. Note to self, work with someone to make it shiny. Check the "Code" section for the source code and the cheapest possible "continous deployment" system.

<h1>Antti's Cover Letter</h1>
<p>
There are few cameleons out there getting software and systems done. Most professionals concern themselves in one single skill. I've deliberately grown my competence and understanding to span multiple diciplines. My core competence is in Agility, management, and simply getting stuff done. 
</p>
<p>
I've coded plenty and I still do to keep my skill up to date. I've architected, and I've integrated systems. I've built an eStore with the help of a supplier, and I've worked on automation and quality of customer software develivery function. I've managed a global, strategic software project with 10+ teams. I've systematically grown the competence of people. I'm have ten years on my belt as a certified Scrum Master. I've done years of work as a Scrum Product Owner. I currently architect for Cloud storage systems (think Dropbox) as SaaS for large operators such as British Telecom. 
</p>
<p>
During my current career I've become very fond in the consulting side of the enterprise dance. I like to listen, try to understand the customer better, and then to lead towards a solution. I have found I have good skills in both elicitating the need and in articulating the implications. I enjoy givig people a direction to go to. 

I see two great paths in front of me. Either to become an Agile/Lean consultant or to become smart consultant, who works on operational effectiveneness. Either way, I know I'll be of value, and I will be happy doing that.
