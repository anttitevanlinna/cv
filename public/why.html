It's hip to do an app as a supplement to the CV. While LinkedIn and my CV can tell a lot, it doesn't quite convey what can one do. In a CV, I can't give you the extra information where one would like. Making an app that does cool stuff can much better showcase your talents. This site is an app that will handle the journey of getting to know Antti's  personality and achievements. The portfolio section tells a few stories of the stuff that I've been working with over the years. 
</p>
<p>
Just one thing: I'm not graphically sawwy nor a frontend coder. The surface that you see is merely there to give you an idea that I can code. (Note to self: work with someone to make it shiny.) Check the "Code" section for the source code and the cheapest possible "continous deployment" system.

<h1>Antti's Cover Letter</h1>
<p>
I've deliberately grown my competence and understanding to span multiple diciplines. My core competence is in Agility, management, and simply getting stuff done.  
There are few cameleons out there getting software and systems done. Most professionals concern themselves in one single skill.  
</p>
<p>
I've coded plenty and I still do to keep my skill up to date. I've architected, and I've integrated systems. I've built an eStore with the help of a supplier, and I've worked on automation and quality of customer software develivery function. I've managed a global, strategic software project with 10+ teams. I've systematically grown the competence of people. I have ten years on my belt as a certified Scrum Master. I've done years of work as a Scrum Product Owner. I currently architect for Cloud storage systems (think Dropbox) as SaaS for the large teleoperators. 
</p>
<p>
During my current career as a solution architect I've become very fond in the consulting side of the engagement between two enterprises. I like to listen, to understand the customer better, and then to lead towards a solution. I have good skills in both discovering the need and in articulating the way forward. I enjoy givig people a direction to go to.
</p>
<p>
I see two great paths in front of me. Either to become an Agile/Lean consultant or to become a consultant, who works on operational effectiveneness. Either way, I know I'll be of value, and I will be happy doing that.
