    <p>
There are few cameleons out there getting software and systems done. Most professionals concern themselves in one single skill. I've deliberately grown my competence and understanding to span multiple diciplines. My core competence is in Agility, management, and simply getting stuff done. 
      
I've coded plenty and I still do to keep my skill up to date. I've architected, and I've integrated systems. I've built an eStore with the help of a supplier, and I've worked on automation and quality of customer software develivery function. I've managed a global, strategic software project with 10+ teams. I've systematically grown the competence of people. I'm have ten years on my belt as a certified Scrum Master. I've done years of work as a Scrum Product Owner. I currently architect for Cloud storage systems (think Dropbox) as SaaS for large operators such as British Telecom. 
      
During my current career I've become very fond in the consulting side of the enterprise dance. I like to listen, try to understand the customer better, and then to lead towards a solution. I have found I have good skills in both elicitating the need and in articulating the implications. I enjoy givig people a direction to go to.
